        introduction="Hi! I'm Kim Andersson, a multifaceted individual weaving through the realms of craftsmanship, anthropology, and the intricate world of demoscene music. Currently immersing myself in the dynamic field of front-end development, I find joy in merging diverse interests like graphics, music, and systems within this digital landscape."
        
        textPart1="My background in carpentry serves as another facet of artistic expression. Working with hands is where a significant part of artistic expression manifests. Designing within carpentry shares similarities with structuring web applications, breaking them down into sections, much like the blocks of a piece of furniture. The design principles in carpentry, dividing structures into parts, echo the styling in CSS/HTML."

        textPart2="My anthropological understanding of human behavior influences my approach to front-end development. I don't view a customer's behavior as 'wrong,' but rather seek to understand and adapt to the truth of how people act in different circumstances."
        
        textPart3="The significance of music in front-end development is evident. Web applications can incorporate sound, such as game music or menu effects. If someone needs a specific sound, my training and experience enable me to assist with that." />
